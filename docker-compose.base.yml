# This is the base docker compose config. The main purpose is to:
# 1. List all of the services & dbs in the system
# 2. Specify the docker image / build context for every service
# 3. Make sure all the components are in the same virtual network "project"
# 4. Make sure all the components are under the same environment variables "PROJECT_*"
# 5. Make sure all the components have the right dependencies on each other
# 6. NO volume mounting
# 7. NO port publishing for internal components
# 8. NO "restart:always" kind of configs that handle fail-over
